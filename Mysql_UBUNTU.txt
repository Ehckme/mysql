######################## REMOVING MY SQL #######################

Step 1: Stop MySQL Service

	sudo systemctl stop MySQL



Step 2: Uninstall MySQL Database
	
	sudo apt purge mysql-server mysql-client mysql-common mysql-server-core-* mysql-client-core-*



Step 3: Remove Configuration Files and Databases

	sudo rm -rf /etc/mysql /var/lib/MySQL



Step 4: Remove Remaining MySQL Packages

	sudo apt autoremove

Step 5:

This should be considered optional and I would advise one to do this. 
After uninstalling applications or packages its good to update the system to be up to-date.

Type the following Command 

sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
